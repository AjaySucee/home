        <h2> 500th Goal </h2>
        
        <p> 
            It was the 2017 El cl√°sico. Both teams had stars of their own and were both masterclasses. 
            While Messi played for Barcelona, the man who rivaled his legacy, Cristiano Ronaldo played 
            for Real Madrid, the opposition team. The game was intensely played. The score went back 
            and forth. The game was tied up after 90 minutes, 2-2. Two extra minutes were given. In the last 
            thirty seconds, Messi scores the tie-breaker to secure the win for Barcelona. That goal goes on 
            to be Messi&rsquo;s 500th goal.

        <h2> World Cup </h2>

        <p>
            Messi&rsquo;s and his team&rsquo;s victory in the 2022 WC series was a massive milestone for 
            Messi&rsquo;s career and put him in a stellar position in the history of football. Throughout 
            Messi&rsquo;s career, he has won multiple awards, but he had not won the WC. In 2014 Messi had
            an opportunity but fell close and won second place in the tournament. In 2022, he emerged
            to the top again for another chance with the world cup. After a difficult series of 
            matches, Argentina makes it to the finals against France. The score stayed in favor of Argentina 
            for most of the game, but Mbappe got the score to be tied. The game went into overtime where Messi 
            and Mbappe scored again, pushing the game to the penalties. In the end, Argentina comes 
            out victorious marking history in football.
